		Homage Technology Ltd. ("we" or "us") provides this Privacy Policy to inform you of our 
policies and procedures regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal information we 
receive when you use Homage mobile App. or visiting the Homage web-site, or registering to the 
Homage service ("App." or "Homage"). By using Homage, you are consenting to the terms and 
practices described in this Policy.
We reserve the right to change this Policy. We will inform you of any such change by posting 
it on this page, with the effective date of any change clearly marked. You are advised to consult 
this Policy regularly for any changes. 
This Policy and Homage may be used by you only if you are over the age of 18 and you can 
form a legally binding contract with us under the laws that apply to you, according to wherever 
you are.

1. INFORMATION COLLECTED

The App. collects personal information when you register or using it. Information which you 
submit to Homage during registration or performance of other actions at Homage may be 
recorded in Homage's designated database (the "Database").
Before using the App. you must undergo a registration process, during which you may be 
required to supply a unique user name and password e-mail addresses, and certain demographic 
information (such as name, gender, year of birth, etc.). From time to time, Homage may collect 
additional personal information from you. If this information is to be shared with a third party, 
we will notify you at the time of collection (except for anonymous, unidentified information 
provided in answer to surveys, which may be shared with our advertisers and partners). 
Alternatively, Homage may offer you to log in through a third party provider, e.g. using your 
Facebook account, in which case the terms of such third party service may apply.
In order to provide you with the App., Homage may securely access or store your user name 
and password, your list of tagged items (including any images attached to items in the list), and 
other personally identifiable data. Homage will not be liable for any data deleted due to the lapse 
of time. In addition, when you use Homage's web site or use the App., we may periodically 
collect your device number or IP address (the location of your device on the Internet), track 
your geographic location, monitor installation and online behavioral information recorded 
during user sessions and technical data and related information (including but not limited to 
technical information about your device, applications installed on it, its operating system and 
your operator). 
We may use cookies to collect information from our site's visitors and/or App. users. A cookie is 
a small data file that we transfer to your computer/ mobile device's hard disk for record-keeping 
purposes. We use persistent cookies to save your username and login password for future logins 
to Homage's website or usage of the App. We use session ID cookies to enable certain features 
of Homage's website or the App, to better understand how you interact with Homage and to 
monitor such usage. You can instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting 
cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the website you visit. If you do not 
accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all portions of Homage or all functionality 
of the App.
Should you communicate with us actively, for example contact us with questions, comments or 

for purposes of feedback, information or customer/technical support, we collect the information 
contained in your message. This may include your contact information and any other personal 
information you choose to provide through such communication. We may also collect such 
information when you ask to be included in our mailing lists as they may be available from 
time to time, or express an interest in hearing more about our offerings, in order to send you 
information in the future regarding us, our partners, related services, promotions or events. 
Another way we may actively collect your contact information is through surveys we may 
conduct from time to time in respect of our products. Participation and providing information 
in surveys is optional. All such communications may be publicly available and should reflect 
how much you want other users to know about you. We recommend that you guard your 
anonymity and sensitive information and we encourage you to think carefully about what 
information about yourself you disclose in your comments or submissions. 

2. HOW WE USE THE INFORMATION THAT IS COLLECTED
We may use the information that we collect to:
• Provide the App. and personalize your experience. 
• Share it with additional users of the App., subject to your specific permission to do so, 
and with others subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy. 
• Measure the effectiveness of ads you and others see, and customize the ads delivered to 
you. 
• Contact you to ask for your satisfaction rate, inform you of technical issues, inquire about 
any features you would like to see in future offerings, or offer you upgrades, promotions 
and additional services or products by us or others that we believe that you may be 
interested in. 
• Send out newsletters to you with articles and information which we believe may be of 
interest to you.
• Analyze your use of the App., location, preferences and trends for our own internal 
statistical and analytical purposes which we may use for general marketing purposes 
and in respect of operations and product development and service improvement in an 
aggregated format that will not include personally identifiable information.
• Conduct research, and provide anonymous reporting for internal and external clients. 
• Enforce our Terms of Service, and to resolve any disputes between users of the App. or 
between such users and us.

3. DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION 

We will use your personal information only for the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy, 
unless we obtain your specific consent. We will not share your personal information with any 
third parties without your permission, unless:
 
(a) We are required to do so by law or when necessary to comply with a current judicial 
proceeding, a court order or legal process served on us, or when we believe in good faith that 
disclosure of information to government or law enforcement officials or private parties is 
necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and legal process (including but not limited to 
subpoenas), to protect our or a third party's property and rights, to protect the safety of the public 
or any person, to prevent or stop any activity we may consider to be, or to pose a risk of being, 
illegal, unethical, inappropriate or legally actionable, or to report suspected illegal activity. 
In all cases, such information will only be disclosed in accordance with applicable laws and 
regulations.
(b) We employ third parties to provide or facilitate the App. (including without limitation hosting 
and marketing services). These third parties have access to your personal information only to 
perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated to comply with this Privacy Policy.
(c) The App. may share any information with its respective employees, officers, directors, 
owners, agents, information providers, affiliates, licensors and licensees (collectively, the 
"Affiliates") or with any site with which Homage's activities shall be incorporated, completely or 
partially.
(d) In the event of a sale (by merger, transfer of all or substantially all of our assets or otherwise), 
liquidation, bankruptcy or reorganization of our company, as required by the relevant parties 
engaging with us in such specific context. The party acquiring the information shall be bound by 
the terms of this Privacy Policy, as applied to such entity. 
In addition, we may provide aggregate statistics about users and other information to third parties 

for commercial or other purposes (including without limitation to deliver targeted advertising 
about other products and services, or provide recommendations of applications), but these 
statistics will not include any personally identifiable information (but may include non-personal 
data such as the country derived from the IP address, age and gender). 

4. LINKS AND THIRD PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS

We do not exercise control over others that provide information, or over banners, other 
advertisements or links you may receive while using Homage's website or the App. These other 
parties may place their own cookies or other files on your device, collect data or solicit personal 
information from you, and follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of personal 
information. We encourage you to read their privacy policies in advance.

5. SECURING THE INFORMATION 

We take reasonable technical and organizational measures to guard against unauthorized or 
unlawful processing of the information collected and against accidental loss or destruction of, 
or damage to, or misuse or alteration of your personal data, but cannot guarantee the security of 
your personal information. 

6. INTERNATIONAL PROCESSING OR TRANSFER

Your information may be processed, maintained or transferred outside of your state, where the 
privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction. You consent to having your 
personal data transferred to and processed in Israel and other jurisdictions in which we may 
operate.

7. CONTACTING US
